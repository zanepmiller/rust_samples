// Module to manage a text interface using hash maps and vectors that allows
// a user to add individuals to departments, and produce an alphabetical list.
// In reference to Rust book 8.3:
//  "Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to
//   add employee names to a department in a company; for example, “Add Sally to
//   Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of
//   all people in a department or all people in the company by department,
//   sorted alphabetically."
