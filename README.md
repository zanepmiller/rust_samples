#   Description

This repository is my implementation of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)
tutorial programming exercises, including most of the suggested extensions and 
learning exercises described in the book. My purpose here is to learn the basics
of programming in Rust in the most idiomatic way possible, to build foundational
skills and - hopefully - generate ideas for future Rust projects.

This repository is complete, until such a time as additional projects are added
to the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).

#   Conclusions

Rust is definitely a language with a learning curve. While it's been
more approachable than some, I feel I've had to contort my normal thought process
(biased mostly toward C++ and Python) to code in a way that is acceptable to the
Rust compiler. That said, I think those contortions have made me a more
thoughtful programmer, so I would hardly say I regret the exercise.

As with most tutorials, I don't *really* feel I have seen what programming in 
Rust is really like; I look forwad to my exercises with [vulkanalia](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia)
to get that experience.
